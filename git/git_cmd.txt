--- Smudge is essentially a way to say, “For the matching items in the Git attributes file, run a set of code (a filter) when those items are checked out of Git.”
--- Clean is the same, but it runs designated code when the matching items are committed back into Git.
$ git config filter.insertDivisionABC.smudge "sed 's/%div/ABC/'"
$ git config filter.insertDivisionABC.clean "sed 's/ision:ABC/ision:%div/'"
$ echo "div*.html filter=insertDivisionABC" > .gitattributes

--- add notes
$ git notes add -m "add f1" fd789a433db21958df0
